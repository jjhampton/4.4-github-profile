# Github Remix

Recreation of my Github profile using data served from the Github API.

I built this in week 4 at The Iron Yard Academy to practice  breaking down a complex sequence into a series of steps, use jQuery AJAX, handle callbacks and asynchronous code, work through the Javascript event loop, and write to the DOM with Javascript.

##Live Demo:
* http://jjhampton.github.io/4.4-github-profile

##Tools & Techniques

- jQuery AJAX promises and callbacks
- Asynchronous code to insert large amounts of JSON to DOM
- SASS and Bourbon for CSS styling and layout
- Bourbon Neat grid for responsive design for the search result columns
- Github Octicons


##Install Dependencies:
* Initial install script at https://github.com/jacobthemyth/cool-scaffolding
* `$ bower install`
